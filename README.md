# Alien-Experiments
Typically Alien style code ideas tend to involve some form of cryptography 
and experimental codes that probe into the unknown.

# Test1
How many iterations of sha on sha does it take to change a lighbulb?
The lightbulb being a trigger word that the sha must contain.
Consider it a proof of work.
We make a 64byte random number and sha it. We then take a sha of the
sha until it matches the lighbulb.
We count how many iterations and the time taken to make matches.
When the count is the same as 1 we stop and record the shas and the seed data.
We discover that single step matches being a direct result of the seed data
means that particular seed data will always produce a sha containing the lightbulb.
Pretty neat way to target hashes and a nice experiment in chaining with proof of work.
